                <p class="paragraph">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a styling language that controls many of the visual elements for a web page.

                    Before CSS, developers had a tough time working with HTML code to format their content in a document, and even then the content was very limited. HTML only was intended to be only a markup language to link various online documents together. HTML was never meant for formatting a page.
                    
                    When HTML 3.2 presented style formatting tags for properties like fonts, it caused difficulties for developers. Programmers would spend a long and expensive process coding lengthy pages of HTML code. This made it difficult to find errors within the HTML syntax if things went wrong in the web page.
                    
                    The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) saw this and adopted CSS to settle the issue. They later went on to create the CSS Working Group dedicated to developing the version of CSS we have today.
                    
                    CSS did HTML, and the tech world in general, a favor and removed all style formatting HTML tags from the page and replaced them with lists of rules called style sheets.
                    
                    If you think of the development of a house or any type of building, HTML represents the basic structure of the building: the walls, stairs, and doors. CSS would represent the paint, decorations, and style of the building. While HTML provides your base structure, CSS provides the style of your webpage— making it stand out among other webpages on the Internet.
                    
                    The style includes the background colors, layout, and even the display style for various types of devices. Additionally, CSS is completely separate from HTML and it can be used by any markup language, including XHTML (a variant of HTML), and XML (Extensible Markup Language).</p>
                <h3 class="titleDevelopment"> ¿How does it work?</h3>
                <p class="paragraph"> CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with individual HTML components called elements. The language enables the separation of presentation and content. This improves accessibility and performance in web page processing. It also provides more flexibility across many pages and reduces repetition and difficulty in the HTML code. Developers style their CSS through a word processor or text editor and link the CSS to HTML in three different ways.

                    External style sheets, the most recommended method, are saved as a separate file from the HTML document with a .css extension. Then every HTML page will pull the style rules from just one CSS reference. This method is recommended if you have several rules that can span across many pages on your website. To use your external style sheet, you include a link tag in your header section of the HTML file that sources to your .css file.
                    
                    Internal style sheets are included within the header section of your HTML file but within a style tag. Internal style sheets are recommended if you have a single page with a couple of rules that are unique to the other pages on your website.
                    
                    Inline style sheets are within the elements in your HTML file. These are small segments of CSS written into the code. Inline style sheets should only be used when the style is a single coding instance in your entire webpage.</p>
